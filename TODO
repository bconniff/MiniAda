TODO

- Class for symbol table
   * What scheme to use for the table?
   * Each symbol needs associated attributes

- getChildren() method for AbstractTreeNodes
   * Implement in each class, or with reflection?

- Visitor to build symbol table (TopDeclVisitor)
   * Uses TypeVisitor to populate the tree with types
   * Enters symbols into table, handling scope
   * Errors for duplicate definitions

- Visitors to check types (TypeVisitor)
   * Populates types between nodes
   * Checks that types are valid
