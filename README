README

MiniAda is a simple compiler for a subset of Ada written in Java using ANTLR,
targeting the SPARC architecture. This project is a work in progress, and
currently only provides a parser.

MiniAda is developed by two students at Radford University, bconniff
(github.com/bconniff) and jdominic (github.com/jdominic). All code is property
of Radford University.

COMPILATION

To compile the parser on a UNIX-like system, use the command:

   make

MiniAda comes with a test program will print out the parse tree for a given
input file. After compilation, you can run the test with the command:

   java Test <file>

Where <file> is the input file for the parser. Similarly, you can use the
command:

   make test

Which will run the parser on all files with the suffix ".adb" in the "test/"
directory, and print out their parse trees.

To delete the files created by running "make", use the command:

   make clean

REQUIREMENTS

MiniAda requires ANTLR version 3, and the Makefile assumes the command antlr3
is available to compile ANTLR grammars. The ANTRL jar file must also be in
Java's classpath. Since MiniAda is written in Java, it also requires a working
Java SDK.

MiniAda has been tested on Arch Linux, running ANTLR version 3.4 and OpenJDK
version 1.70.

DIFFERENCES FROM ADA

Although the MiniAda compiler implements a language similar to the Ada95
programming language, there are some differences. For example, MiniAda uses
the backtick character (`) instead of the apostrophe (') for variable
attributes. For example, one must write:

   Integer`range

Instead of:

   Integer'range

MiniAda also requires spaces inside of discrete range literals. For example,
the following is not currently valid in MiniAda:

   3..5

However, this will work fine:

   3 .. 5
